# Face-detection-using-YOLO-model
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using YOLOv8/YOLOv11 fine-tuned on a custom face dataset. Designed for performance and accuracy, the model is trained and optimized to detect faces in diverse conditions with high precision, making it suitable for surveillance, interactive apps, and smart monitoring systems.
